# Recognizing-Shapes-in-Images-with-OpenCV
To apply computer vision techniques to process images, extract useful features and detect shapes using Hough transforms.  By the end of this project, we will have analyzed real-world images using industry standard tools, including Python and OpenCV.

Project Objectives

In this course, we are going to focus on five learning objectives:

By the end of task 1, you will be able to load an image from file.

By the end of task 2, you will be able to compute image gradients.

By the end of task 3, you will be able to detect edges in an image.

By the end of task 4, you will be able to recognize lines in an image using Hough transforms.

By the end of task 5, you will be able to recognize circles in an image using Hough transforms.


Project Structure

This project on Recognizing Shapes in Images with OpenCV is divided into following tasks:

Task 1: Load an image from file
Task 2: Compute image gradients
Task 3: Detect edges in an image
Task 4: Recognize lines in an image
Task 5: Recognize circles in an image
